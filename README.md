# MagicMirror² - Smart Mirror

**Project Description:**
This project involves the development of a **Smart Mirror** based on the MagicMirror² platform, which allows users to display personalized information on a mirror using configurable modules. Data such as weather, calendar, news, reminders, and many other features can be displayed thanks to its modular system.

The goal of this project is to transform a conventional mirror into an interactive assistant by integrating hardware and software, using MagicMirror² with Node.js and Electron.
